 ### There are 3 sections, namely:
      a. A “file explorer” pane that contains 3 files: index.html, index.css, index.js.
      b. A “code editor” that supports syntax highlighting for HTML, CSS, and JS.
      c. A “live view” section to show the rendered HTML website.
      
 ### How it works?
  1. Clicking on a file from the “file explorer” displays the corresponding content on
     the code editor for editing.
  2. The “live view” section displays the rendered website that was created by the
     user. When a change is made to any of the index.html, index.css, or index.js files,
     the “live view” section hot-reloads and displays the new output.
  3. The codes written in the editor are also downloadable using the "DOWNLOAD HTML" , "DOWNLOAD CSS" and "DOWNLOAD JS" buttons and are downloaded as 'index.html' , 'index.css'      and 'index.js' respectively.
