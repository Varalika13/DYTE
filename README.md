## An online code editor using React 



## DEPLOYED ON GITPAGES AT - https://varalika13.github.io/DYTE/index.html



 # There are 3 sections, namely:
      a. A “file explorer” pane that contains 3 files: index.html, index.css, index.js.
      b. A “code editor” that supports syntax highlighting for HTML, CSS, and JS.
      c. A “live view” section to show the rendered HTML website.
      
 # How it works?
  -Clicking on a file from the “file explorer” displays the corresponding content on
the code editor for editing.
  -The “live view” section displays the rendered website that was created by the
user. When a change is made to any of the index.html, index.css, or index.js files,
the “live view” section hot-reloads and displays the new output.
  -The codes written in the editor are also downloadable using the "DOWNLOAD HTML" , "DOWNLOAD CSS" and "DOWNLOAD JS" buttons and are downloaded as 'index.html' , 'index.css' and 'index.js' respectively.
